1. The plugin is way more customizable. Nearly every core feature can be turned on or off, or can even be changed.
2. This plugin is way more user-friendly than other similar plugins.

## Installation

The installation for the plugin is similar to all other plugins.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to download the correct version!

1. Download the latest release. A .jar file will be downloaded.
2. In your server files, locate the 'plugins' folder.
3. Cut (Ctrl+X) and Paste (Ctrl+V) the .jar file into the folder.

> [!TIP]
> Use Paper if you want to have the smoothest and most enjoyable experience; Paper is a fork of Spigot with a more expansive plugin API, which other versions may not have.
