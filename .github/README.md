# rTPA

> [!CAUTION]
> This plugin is not released yet! It is still in active development. When the plugin is ready for use, an announcement will be posted.

A Minecraft Server plugin that adds TPA and rTPA functionality and is maintained frequently.

## Features

This plugin allows the player to request to teleport to another player. There are benefits to using this plugin over others, such as;
1. The plugin is way more customizable. Nearly every core feature can be turned on or off, or can even be changed.
2. rTPA includes a new feature; friending. If you have someone friended, you can teleport to them without sending a request.
3. This plugin is way more user-friendly than other similar plugins.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> Use Paper if you want to have the smoothest and most enjoyable experience; Paper is a fork of Spigot with more features than other software.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to download the correct version!

The installation for the plugin is similar to all other plugins. If you are using the latest version;

1. Download the latest release. A .jar file will be downloaded.
2. In your server files, locate the 'plugins' folder.
3. Cut (Ctrl+X) and Paste (Ctrl+V) the .jar file into the folder.

If you need a specific version of the plugin, you can locate them in the releases tab.

## Commands

- `/tpa <player>` - Send a teleport request to the player.
- `/tpahere <player>` - Send a request for the player to teleport to you.
- `/tpaccept <player>` - Accept the pending teleport request.
- `/tpadeny` - Denies the pending teleport request.
- `/tpacancel` - Cancels the outgoing teleport request.
- `/rtpa` - Opens the user settings for the plugin.
- `/rtpa friend <player>` - Sends in a request to friend the player.

> [!TIP]
> Friending is a powerful tool that can be exploited easily! Only friend those who you trust.

## Contributing

### Did you find an issue with the plugin?
Please send in an issue if you can! [Please open an issue](https://github.com/slapplgod/rTPA/issues) and specify all details so that the bug gets fixed as soon as possible.

If a bug requires my immediate attention for any reason, [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/PryepsUf6Y) and open a ticket.

### Are you requesting a feature?
Please do understand that I appreciate all feature requests, but they will be likely denied for 2 reasons;
1. I cannot work on requests that are out of my skill level. If I can't do something, it probably won't be worked on.
2. I cannot work on requests that are not important to the project. A TPA plugin shouldn't include shaders and vice-versa.

If you believe that your request follows these rules, [open a request.](https://github.com/slapplgod/rTPA/issues)

### Do you wish to contribute to the project?
Thank you for doing so! Here's a few things to clarify before you move on;
1. For security reasons, you will not be able to work directly on the repository, you will have to [fork the repository](https://github.com/slapplgod/rTPA/fork) and work on it there.
2. Please do understand that my coding skills are not the best. While I can read and understand code, I can't really write code myself without some kind of help, so apologies if I sometimes miss bugs or respond slow.

If you are still happy to contribute, please follow [this guideline]() for contributing.
