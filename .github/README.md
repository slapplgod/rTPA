## Features

This plugin allows the player to request to teleport to another player. There are benefits to using this plugin over others, such as;
1. The plugin is way more customizable. Nearly every core feature can be turned on or off, or can even be changed.
2. This plugin is way more user-friendly than other similar plugins.
